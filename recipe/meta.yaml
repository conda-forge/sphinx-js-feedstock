  summary: Autodoc-style extraction into Sphinx for your JS project

  description: |
    When you write a JavaScript library, how do you explain it to people? If
    it's a small project in a domain your users are familiar with, JSDoc's
    alphabetical list of routines might suffice. But in a larger project, it is
    useful to intersperse prose with your API docs without having to copy and
    paste things.

    sphinx-js lets you use the industry-leading Sphinx documentation tool with
    JS projects. It provides a handful of directives, patterned after the
    Python-centric autodoc ones, for pulling JSDoc-formatted documentation into
    reStructuredText pages. And, because you can keep using JSDoc in your code,
    you remain compatible with the rest of your JS tooling, like Google's
    Closure Compiler.
